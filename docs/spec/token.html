<h1 id="specification-bqn-token-formation"><a class="header" href="#specification-bqn-token-formation">Specification: BQN token formation</a></h1>
<p>This page describes BQN's token formation rules (token formation is also called scanning). Most tokens in BQN are a single character long, but quoted characters and strings, identifiers, and numbers can consist of multiple characters, and comments, spaces, and tabs are discarded during token formation. Additionally, identifier, literal, and primitive tokens are assigned a syntactic role that determines how they are seen by the grammar. The case-insensitive matching of identifiers and special names is described in the <a href="scope.html">scoping rules</a>, not here.</p>
<p>BQN source code should be considered as a series of unicode code points, which we refer to as &quot;characters&quot;. Implementers should note that not all languages treat unicode code points as atomic, as exposing the UTF-8 or UTF-16 representation instead is common. For a language such as JavaScript that uses UTF-16, the double-struck characters <code><span class='Value'>𝕨𝕩𝕗𝕘𝕤</span><span class='Function'>𝕎𝕏𝔽𝔾𝕊</span><span class='Value'>𝕣</span></code> are represented as two 16-bit surrogate characters, but BQN treats them as a single unit. The line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR) characters are both considered newline characters.</p>
<p>A BQN <em>character literal</em> consists of a single character between single quotes, such as <code><span class='String'>'a'</span></code>, and a <em>string literal</em> consists of any number of characters between double quotes, such as <code><span class='String'>&quot;&quot;</span></code> or <code><span class='String'>&quot;abc&quot;</span></code>. Character and string literals take precedence with comments over other tokenization rules, so that <code><span class='Comment'>#</span></code> between quotes does not start a comment and whitespace between quotes is not removed, but a quote within a comment does not start a character literal. Almost any character can be included directly in a character or string literal without escaping. The only exception is the double quote character <code><span class='String'>&quot;</span></code>, which must be written twice to include it in a string, as otherwise it would end the string instead. Character literals require no escaping at all, as the length is fixed. In particular, literals for the double and single quote characters are written <code><span class='String'>'''</span></code> and <code><span class='String'>'&quot;'</span></code>, while length-1 strings containing these characters are <code><span class='String'>&quot;'&quot;</span></code> and <code><span class='String'>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></code>.</p>
<p>A <em>comment</em> consists of the hash character <code><span class='Comment'>#</span></code> and any following text until (not including) the next newline character. The initial <code><span class='Comment'>#</span></code> must not be part of a string literal started earlier. Comments are ignored entirely and do not form tokens.</p>
<p>Several <em>word tokens</em> including identifiers and numbers share a token formation rule. Word tokens are formed from the <em>numeric characters</em> <code><span class='Number'>¯∞π0123456789</span></code>, <em>alphabetic characters</em> <code><span class='Modifier'>_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</span></code>, and the oddball <code><span class='Value'>𝕣</span></code>. Additionally, <code><span class='Value'>.</span></code> is considered a numeric character if it is followed immediately by a digit (<code><span class='Number'>0123456789</span></code>); otherwise it forms its own token. Any sequence of these characters adjacent to each other forms a single token, along with up to one <em>system dot</em> <code><span class='Value'>•</span></code> immediately before. The combined token is a <em>system literal</em> if it begins with a system dot, a <em>numeric literal</em> if it begins with a numeric character and an <em>identifier</em> if it begins with an alphabetic character.</p>
<p>Some additional rules apply to word tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a token begins with an underscore then its first non-underscore character must be alphabetic: for example, <code><span class='Modifier'>_99</span></code> is not a valid token.</li>
<li>Numeric literals must conform to the grammar given in the <a href="literal.html">numeric literal rules</a>.</li>
<li>A system literal token is valid only if its name, excluding the leading <code><span class='Value'>•</span></code>, matches a defined <a href="system.html">system value</a>, ignoring underscores and letter case as with identifiers.</li>
<li>If any token contains <code><span class='Value'>𝕣</span></code> it can only be <code><span class='Value'>𝕣</span></code>, <code><span class='Modifier'>_𝕣</span></code>, or <code><span class='Modifier2'>_𝕣_</span></code>, and is considered a special name (as the value taken by this identifier can only be a modifier, the uppercase character <code><span class='Value'>ℝ</span></code> is not allowed).</li>
</ul>
<p>After the steps to form the multi-character tokens described above, the whitespace characters space and tab are ignored, and do not form tokens. These characters and the newline characters, which do form tokens, are the only whitespace characters allowed.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a single character forms a token. Only the specified set of characters can be used; others result in an error. The classes of characters are given below.</p>

<h2 id="syntactic-role"><a class="header" href="#syntactic-role">Syntactic role</a></h2>
<p>Literal, primitive, and identifier tokens are assigned to terminals in the grammar according to their <em>syntactic role</em>. The four possible roles are subject, function, 1-modifier, and 2-modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric literals, character literals including the null literal, and string literals have a subject role.</li>
<li>Primitives have a function, 1-modifier, or 2-modifier role according to their class.</li>
<li>A system literal has the same role it would have if it appeared without the <code><span class='Value'>•</span></code>.</li>
<li>An identifier token may have any role depending on its spelling, as defined below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of an identifier token may depend on its first character, and on whether the last character is an underscore, as shown in the table below. If the identifier starts with a lowercase letter, it has a subject role, and if it starts with an uppercase letter, then it has a function role. If it starts with an underscore, the identifier is a modifier, specifically a 2-modifier if it ends with another underscore and a 1-modifier if not.</p>

<p>The special names <code><span class='Value'>𝕨𝕩𝕗𝕘𝕤𝕣</span></code> my be considered to have a subject role, <code><span class='Function'>𝕎𝕏𝔽𝔾𝕊</span></code> to have a function role, and <code><span class='Modifier'>_𝕣</span></code> and <code><span class='Modifier2'>_𝕣_</span></code> to have 1-modifier and 2-modifier roles. However, special names are treated individually in the grammar specification rather than being grouped by role.</p>
