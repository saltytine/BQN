<p>Pages in this directory discuss advanced compilation strategies for BQN, that is, steps that might take take place after compiling to bytecode or a similar intermediate representation. Most content here is currently speculative: C, Java, and Javascript backends are capable of compiling to native (x86, JVM, or Javascript) code in order to lower evaluation overhead but don't perform much if any analysis to improve this code. CBQN is likely to start making such optimizations in the future.</p>

<p>The self-hosted bytecode compiler isn't really documented, but there are some related resources elsewhere. I held a few early chat discussions on building an array-based compiler, but aborted these because the interactive format wasn't doing too much.</p>
