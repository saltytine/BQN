# Is BQN mathematics?

Array programming is an industrious burrowing creature, and its tunnels spread unseen across the land. It tangles and tussles with beasts declarative and functional, and snarls at the sequential. Ken Iverson, a lowlier creature, tended the garden of linear algebra to free his graduate students of tangled patches, and holes in the earth. Just as he looked at one of these holes, a head poked out. Ken gave chase, little knowing that he'd spend years digging and crawling. At one point, he stopped to take stock of his explorations through the beast's burrowâ€”and, although he would never find the seams, others that ran into it. "How great", exclaimed Iverson, "is the garden of linear algebra!"

For better or worse, BQN ditches linear algebra: APL primitives for matrix multiplication, division, and determinant are demoted to idioms and libraries, and names like "matrix" and "outer product" for more generally-applicable concepts are changed (sadly both of these get called "table" though). It's still true that programming can be used to implement mathematics and mathematics to describe programming, but BQN doesn't stand out relative to other languages in this respect.
